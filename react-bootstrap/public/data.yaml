    Bob is a Minion who is more childish and immature than most of the other Minions. 
    He is described as a "Little Brother" who finds love in anything and everything, including a rat (who he named Poochy) he found in a sewer in the Minions film. 
    He also enjoys bedtime stories and playing with his favorite stuffed teddy bear, Tim. 
    However, in the audition scene in Despicable Me 2 (having grown since the time of Minions), 
      he became more plumper which made him look more like the short and plump Minions with spiky hair, just no hair. 
    Is also shown more mature, albeit still playful, as well as more of a goofball like all the other Minions.

    Bob was the only Minion interested in Kevin's journey, after begging him he was able to join. 
    On the way to their destination, Kevin carried him sometimes. 
    Bob is tired, grew hungry halfway through the journey and tries to eat Kevin with Stuart, 
      who has a hallucination that the minions are speaking bananas.
    When arriving to New York, Bob is quite interested in a parade against the war, so he holds a sign with "BOO-YA!" on it. 
    Later, the trio visit an album store, and Bob follows a female customer because her clothes have lots of bananas drawn on it. 
    Soon, Bob is accidentally brought into the taxi with the woman's baggage by the taxi driver; 
      she soon, notices Bob and shrieks then throws him and his teddy bear out. 
    Then, he enters a department store while Kevin and Stuart search for him after noticing him missing. 
    Kevin grabs the loudspeaker of the store and calls Bob, while Bob enters a changing room, thinking Kevin is inside. 
    In the room, he sees lots of mirrors on the wall seeing his reflection, he thinks it is his buddies, he runs bumping into it and discovers it's not real. 
    Kevin goes into the room, and Bob tells Kevin he misses the tribe. 
    Kevin hands him his teddy bear just before the light goes out.
